            * How TDD saved me big delay in short term project.

            It's easy to get started and not so easy to make it right. Cloud requires serious thought and serious investment into learning the new concepts before one can understand what the trade-offs are.
            We all heard of the horror stories of raking incredible fees by simply not understanding that having the infinite scaling set up creates infinite cost scaling as well.
            Through many demanding migration projects, I realized there is no way I can satisfy the demand. There is simply no way to teach many organizations to bootstrap their cloud efforts right. So, I built the solution for that demand - a concentrated solution based on the verified, battle-tested configurations I made for clients throughout the years. One with proper security in place and tailored for real-world scenarios I encountered in my work.
            The goal was to ease the migration, cut down the migration cost and duration, and increase the reliability and stability of the new system. But to make something like it, you first have to figure out which "templates" fit most of the use cases, and are a good fit to start extending for those cases which require more specializations.

            This session explains how recent development in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes gap between human and machine smaller than ever before, by explaining and comparing traditional approach user in development of AI systems with new approach that has been used by AI system AlphaZero, developed by DeepMind. Traditionally AI systems have been tested in chess and the same has been done to demonstrate the power of AlphaZero. But, instead of playing against human, it played against the best (at the time) chess program Stockfish. While chess programs (before AlphaZero), were using powerful hardware and embedded built-in formal knowledge about the game, AlphaZero is using completely new approach, running on standard hardware and using deep learning. It learned about the game by playing a large number of games with itself, learning in the process. Session will also explain what is so revolutionary in AlphaZero approach to AI and how this new approach can be used in different areas of processing visual information, bio-medicine, autonomous driving, robotics and AI generated images/videos of humans.
