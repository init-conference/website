    It's a story of a sudden and unexpected personal and professional transformation.

    Test driven development(TDD) has become standard. Writing tests in right way can make difference between delivering high quality code on time and a catastrophic failure. However in practice we usually don't apply TDD at all or make some crucial mistakes when doing so. Let's focus on mistakes we frequently make. Why do we repeat them? How can we fix those when it's not only up to us?

    We will cover:
    1. Story about my interview project:
    * How TDD saved me big delay in short term project.
    * How this would effect on bigger projects?

    2. Why sometimes we don't write tests? How it slow us down?
    * In order to deliver faster we sometimes don't write tests.
    * How it actually slow us down?
    * What other problems it makes?
    * Why sometimes we claim to use TDD, but actually we don't.
    * What frequent mistakes we make.

    3. Basic concepts of TDD

    4. Good practices:
    * Anti-patterns in testing
    * Test coverage - How to decide where to write tests?
    * How to write tests easier, faster and more reusable?

    5. Helpers in testing:
    * Helpers and libraries that will improve your test writing.
    * Few simple NodeJS examples.

    6. Summary:
    * Let's not repeat same mistake.
    * Write tests, write them by TDD and write them properly.
    * Learn more about good practices, helpers and libraries.
    * Improve your code by adding tests/refactoring old tests.

    Zero downtime migration from a legacy stack based on Jenkins, Ansible, Icinga, HAproxy, nginx, uwsgi, pypi, and Tomcat to a new one based on Travis, Docker, CloudFormation and ECS/Fargate with assorted tech debt solved on the way there.

    Cloud has been a buzzword for almost ten years now, but still, a considerable portion of systems isn't "up there". The reasons vary from being scared through not having enough time to investigate it properly, to valid legal and/or technical reasons.
    It's easy to get started and not so easy to make it right. Cloud requires serious thought and serious investment into learning the new concepts before one can understand what the trade-offs are.
    We all heard of the horror stories of raking incredible fees by simply not understanding that having the infinite scaling set up creates infinite cost scaling as well.
    Through many demanding migration projects, I realized there is no way I can satisfy the demand. There is simply no way to teach many organizations to bootstrap their cloud efforts right. So, I built the solution for that demand - a concentrated solution based on the verified, battle-tested configurations I made for clients throughout the years. One with proper security in place and tailored for real-world scenarios I encountered in my work.
    The goal was to ease the migration, cut down the migration cost and duration, and increase the reliability and stability of the new system. But to make something like it, you first have to figure out which "templates" fit most of the use cases, and are a good fit to start extending for those cases which require more specializations.
    Don't get me wrong... this isn't a sales talk, this is a talk about that journey, full of recommendations how to move to the cloud... any cloud, since the patterns and services are almost the same.
    So please join to see us taking off the "mystery veil" off of the cloud, and discussing how to build your cloud native and/or hybrid cloud system without much fuss.

Traditionally AI systems have been tested in chess and the same has been done to demonstrate the power of AlphaZero. But, instead of playing against human, it played against the best (at the time) chess program Stockfish. While chess programs (before AlphaZero), were using powerful hardware and embedded built-in formal knowledge about the game, AlphaZero is using completely new approach, running on standard hardware and using deep learning. It learned about the game by playing a large number of games with itself, learning in the process. Session will also explain what is so revolutionary in AlphaZero approach to AI and how this new approach can be used in different areas of processing visual information, bio-medicine, autonomous driving, robotics and AI generated images/videos of humans.
